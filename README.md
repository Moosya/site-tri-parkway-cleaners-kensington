# Demo site template (Daily 10)

Canonical copy of the Friday 2026-09-25 demo template, fixed 2026-09-26:

- `<title>` is baked from `public/config.json` `shopName` at build time (`vite.config.js`), never "Local shop".
- Hero photo is self-hosted: `public/hero.jpg` + `"photoUrl": "/hero.jpg"`. A dead third-party URL can't break it.
  `src/main.js` also falls back to `/hero.jpg`, then hides the image, if `photoUrl` fails to load.
- No generic "shop"/"storefront" in customer-facing copy ("Neighborhood business", "for your business").
- Team CTAs unchanged: Call us / Text us / Email us -> ownerPhone (908) 286-8650 / troupe.javelin-7w@icloud.com.

Build a new demo with `python3 /workspace/daily-owner-dials/build_demo_site.py ...` (copies this folder, writes
config, picks the hero photo by category). Then run `check_demo_assets.py <live url>` before dialing.

## Asset paths (required — Tue 2026-10-06 incident)
All runtime assets resolve **relative to the page** via `assetUrl()` in `src/main.js`, and `vite.config.js` sets
`base: "./"`. Never use root-absolute `/config.json` or `/hero.jpg`: on GitHub Pages the site lives at
`moosya.github.io/site-xxx/`, so `/config.json` hits the domain root and 404s ("Could not load this page").
Deploy Pages demos with `../deploy_pages_demo.sh site-<slug>` (syncs template code, builds, pushes gh-pages,
no force-push), then `python3 ../check_demo_assets.py <url>` (now fails on root-absolute paths in the JS bundle).
